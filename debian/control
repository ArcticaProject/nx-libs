Description: nx-X11
 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 This package provides the core nx-X11 libraries customized for
 nxagent.

Description: NX agent
 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 nxagent is an agent providing NX transport of X sessions. The application
 is based on the well known Xnest "nested" server. nxagent, like Xnest,
 is an X server for its own clients, and at the same time, an X client
 for a system's local X server.
 .
 The main scope of nxagent is to eliminate X round-trips or transform
 them into asynchronous replies. nxagent works together with nxproxy. 
 nxproxy itself does not make any effort to minimize round-trips
 by itself, this is demanded of nxagent.
 .
 Being an X server, nxagent is able to resolve all the property/atoms related
 requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of round-trips are
 nearly reduced to zero.

Description: X2Go agent
 X2Go is a software suite that uses NX technology for remote desktop
 computing.
 .
 NX technology implements a very efficient compression of the X11 protocol.
 This increases performance when using X applications over a network,
 especially a slow one.
 .
 X2Go agent functionality has been completely incorporated into NX agent's
 code base. If the nxagent binary is executed under the name of `x2goagent',
 the X2Go functionalities get activated.
 .
 The x2goagent package is a wrapper that activates X2Go branding in nxagent.
 Please refer to the nxagent package's description for more information on NX.
