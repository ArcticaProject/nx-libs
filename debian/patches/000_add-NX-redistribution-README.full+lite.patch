+NX redistribution by X2Go
+-------------------------
+This source tree is a re-distribution of those NX packages needed to
+setup FreeNX and/or X2Go on a Linux server.
+
+The NX re-distribution currently is maintained by the X2Go Project:
+http://wiki.x2go.org
+
+Our goal is: 
+    - provide _one_ tarball that builds NX projects via a common Makefile
+    - provide _one_ tarball for distribution packagers
+
+This re-distribution contains the following tarballs derived from
+NoMachine (http://www.nomachine.com/sources.php):
+
+  nxcomp
+  nxcompext
+  nxcompshad
+  nxproxy
+  nx-X11
+  nxagent
+  nxauth
+
+The patches we apply are shipped with this tarball, for further introspection
+please refer to this folder:
+
+  doc/applied-patches
+
+This source tree is maintained on the X2Go Git server:
+Browsing...     http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary
+Git-Cloning...  git clone git://code.x2go.org/nx-libs.git

+a bug, then please contact the X2Go developers on
