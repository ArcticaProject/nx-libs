 * Tell to the proxy how to handle the standard POSIX signals. For

 *
 * NX_SIGNAL_ENABLE:  A signal handler will have to be installed by
 *                    the library, so that it can be intercepted by
 *                    the proxy.
 *
 * NX_SIGNAL_DISABLE: The signal will be handled by the caller and,
 *                    eventually, forwarded to the proxy by calling
 *                    NXTransSignal() explicitly.
 *
 * NX_SIGNAL_RAISE:   The signal must be handled now, as if it had
 *                    been delivered by the operating system. This
 *                    function can be called by the agent with the
 *                    purpose of propagating a signal to the proxy.
 *
 * NX_SIGNAL_FORWARD: A signal handler will have to be installed by
 *                    the library but the library will have to call
 *                    the original signal handler when the signal
 *                    is received.
 *
 * As a rule of thumb, agents should let the proxy handle SIGUSR1
 * and SIGUSR2, used for producing the NX protocol statistics, and
 * SIGHUP, used for disconnecting the NX transport.
 *
 * The following signals are blocked by default upon creation of the
 * NX transport:
 *
 * SIGCHLD    These signals should be always put under the control
 * SIGUSR1    of the proxy. If agents are intercepting them, agents
 * SIGUSR2    should later call NXTransSignal(..., NX_SIGNAL_RAISE)
 * SIGHUP     to forward the signal to the proxy. As an alternative
 *            they can specify a NX_SIGNAL_FORWARD action, so they,
 *            in turn, can be notified about the signal. This can
 *            be especially useful for SIGCHLD.
 *
 * SIGINT     These signals should be intercepted by agents. Agents
 * SIGTERM    should ensure that NXTransDestroy() is called before
 *            exiting, to give the proxy a chance to shut down the
 *            NX transport.
 *
 * SIGPIPE    This signal is blocked by the proxy, but not used to
 *            implement any functionality. It can be handled by the
 *            NX agent without affecting the proxy.
 *
 * SIGALRM    This is now used by the proxy and agents should not
 *            redefine it. Agents can use the signal to implement
 *            their own timers but should not interleave calls to
 *            the NX transport and should restore the old handler
 *            when the timeout is raised.
 *
 * SIGVTALRM  These signals are not used but may be used in future
 * SIGWINCH   versions of the library.
 * SIGIO
 * SIGTSTP
 * SIGTTIN
 * SIGTTOU
 *
 * By calling NXTransSignal(..., NX_SIGNAL_DISABLE) nxcomp will res-
 * tore the signal handler that was saved at the time the proxy hand-
 * ler was installed. This means that you should call the function
 * just after the XOpenDisplay() or any other function used to init-
 * ialize the NX transport.

 * presumably the display pointer, given that at the present moment
 * the NX transport doesn't have access to the display structure and
 * so wouldn't be able to determine the display to pass to the call-
 * back function.
 *
 * NX_HANDLER_FLUSH:      The handler function is called when some
 *                        more data has been written to the proxy
 *                        link.
 *
 * The data is the number of bytes written.
 *
 * NX_HANDLER_STATISTICS: This handler is called to let the agent
 *                        include arbitrary data in the transport
 *                        statistics. The parameter, in this case,

 *                        time the handler is registered. The point-
 *                        ed string will have to be filled by the
 *                        agent with its statistics data.
 *
 * The data can be NX_STATISTICS_PARTIAL or NX_STATISTICS_TOTAL. The
 * agent can refer to the value by using the  NXStatisticsPartial and
 * NXStatisticsTotal constants defined in NXvars.h.
 *
 * Note that these interfaces are used by Xlib and nxcompext. Agents
 * should never call these interfaces directly, but use the nxcompext

 * the proxy the remote port where the channel has to be connected,
 * but also gives a hint about the type of data that will be carried
 * by the channel, so that the proxy can try to optimize the traffic
 * on the proxy link.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_X:     The channel will carry X traffic and it
 *                   will be connected to the remote X display.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_CUPS:  The channel will carry CUPS/IPP protocol.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_SMB:   The channel will carry SMB/CIFS protocol.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_MEDIA: The channel will transport audio or other
 *                   multimedia data.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_HTTP:  The channel will carry HTTP protocol.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_FONT:  The channel will forward a X font server
 *                   connection.
 *
 * NX_CHANNEL_SLAVE: The channel will forward data to a remote slave
 *                   command (see NX_SLAVE_CMD environment variable)
 *
 * Only a proxy running at the NX server/X client side will be able
 * to create a X, CUPS, SMB, MEDIA and HTTP channel. A proxy running
 * at the NX client/X server side can create font server connections.
 * The channel creation will also fail if the remote end has not been
 * set up to forward the connection.
 *
 * To create a new channel the agent will have to set up a socketpair
 * and pass to the proxy one of the socket descriptors.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * #include <sys/types.h>
 * #include <sys/socket.h>
 *
 * int fds[2];
 *
 * if (socketpair(PF_LOCAL, SOCK_STREAM, 0, fds) < 0)
 * {
 *   ...
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *   //
 *   // Use fds[0] locally and let the
 *   // proxy use fds[1].
 *   //
 *
 *   if (NXTransChannel(NX_FD_ANY, fds[1], NX_CHANNEL_X) <= 0)
 *   {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 *   //
 *   // The agent can now use fds[0] in
 *   // read(), write() and select()
 *   // system calls.
 *   //
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * Note that all the I/O on the descriptor should be non-blocking, to
 * give a chance to the NX transport to run in the background and handle
 * the data that will be fed to the agent's side of the socketpair. This
 * will happen automatically, as long as the agent uses the XSelect()
 * version of the select() function (as it is normal whenever performing
 * Xlib I/O). In all the other cases, like presumably in the agent's main
 * loop, the agent will have to loop through NXTransPrepare(), NXTrans-
 * Select() and NXTransExecute() functions explicitly, adding to the sets
 * the descriptors that are awaited by the agent. Please check the imple-
 * mentation of _XSelect() in nx-X11/lib/X11/XlibInt.c for an example.
