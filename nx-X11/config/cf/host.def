/******************************************************************************/
/*
 * This file is to provide a quick method for most people to change the
 * behaviour of their Xorg installation without having to fully
 * understand the workings of site.def and all the various '.cf' files.
 *
 * In the vast majority of cases, it should not be necessary to use this
 * file at all or change it in any way.
 *
 * This file is divided into two sections.  The first contains settings
 * that end-users might reasonably change.  The second contains settings
 * that developers might want to change.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:  In all cases changing the defaults may cause problems
 * and/or unexpected side-effects.  If you don't understand what a setting
 * does, then it's best to not change it.  If you make changes and have
 * problems, verify that those problems are also present when using an
 * empty host.def file and unchanged version of this file before reporting
 * them.
 *
 * A good way to use this file is to copy it to host.def, and make the
 * changes there.  That way, future patches to this file won't fail.
 * The host.def file will never be patched.
 *
 * The distributed version of this file MUST contain no uncommented
 * definitions.  Default definitions belong in xorg.cf, or <vendor>.cf
 * files.
