/*************************************************************************
 * Export list for libX11
 * This list *must* be updated whenever a change is made to the API.
 * 
 * The syntax for the symbol declarations in this list is below.
 *      public       sym => Public   C   symbol, i.e., publicized API
 *      publicC++    sym => Public   C++ symbol, i.e., publicized API
 *      private      sym => Private  C   symbol, i.e., unpublicized API
 *      privateC++   sym => Private  C++ symbol, i.e., unpublicized API
 *      internal     sym => Internal C   symbol, i.e., not part of API
 *      internalC++  sym => Internal C++ symbol, i.e., not part of API
 *      force        sym => symbol to be exported even if not found.  Some
 *	                    restrictions may apply.  Avoid this directive.
 *
 * Note that exporting C++ symbols is not portable; different
 * compilers may use different name mangling schemes and different
 * hidden name (e.g. virtual function table) generation schemes.
 *
 * In addition a single "default" directive may appear, specifying how
 * unmentioned symbols should be treated.  The possible options are:
 *	default			Warn about implicit symbols and hide them.
 *	default public		Export public symbols implicitly.
 *	default private		Export public symbols implicitly.
 *	default internal	Hide public symbols implicitly.
 *
