<H1>Bug Database</H1>

<p>
The Mesa bug database is now hosted on
<a href="http://freedesktop.org" target="_parent">freedesktop.org</a>
instead of SourceForge.
</p>

<p>
To file a Mesa bug, go to
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mesa"
target="_parent">
Bugzilla on freedesktop.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Please follow these bug reporting guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you're using the most recent version of Mesa
<li>Make sure your bug isn't already reported
<li>Include as much information as possible in the report
<li>Provide a simple GLUT-based test program if possible
<li>Check back for follow-ups to the report
</ul>

<p>
Bug reports will automatically be forwarded to the Mesa developer's mailing
list.
</p>

<p>
The easier a bug is to reproduce, the sooner it will be fixed.
Please do everything you can to facilitate quickly fixing bugs.
If your bug report is vague or your test program doesn't compile
easily, the problem may not be fixed very quickly.
