<p>
We can always use more help with the Mesa project.
Here are some specific ideas and areas where help would be appreciated:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Enable -Wstrict-aliasing=2 -fstrict-aliasing and track down aliasing
issues in the code.
<li>
Windows 98/NT driver building, maintenance and testing
<li>
Maintenance and testing of lesser-used drivers, such as DOS/DJGPP, GGI, etc.
</ol>


<p>
If you want to help with Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.
Then post a message to propose what you want to do, just to make sure
there's no issues.
</p>

</p>
Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project.
By doing so, it's assumed that you agree to the code's licensing terms.
</p>

<p>
Finally:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Try to write high-quality code that follows the existing style.
<li>Use uniform indentation, write comments, use meaningful identifiers, etc.
