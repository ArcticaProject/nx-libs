/* A layer on top of the intel_regions code which adds:
 *
 * - Code to size and layout a region to hold a set of mipmaps.
 * - Query to determine if a new image fits in an existing tree.
 *
 * The fixed mipmap layout of intel hardware where one offset
 * specifies the position of all images in a mipmap hierachy
 * complicates the implementation of GL texture image commands,
 * compared to hardware where each image is specified with an
 * independent offset.
 *
 * In an ideal world, each texture object would be associated with a
 * single bufmgr buffer or 2d intel_region, and all the images within
 * the texture object would slot into the tree as they arrive.  The
 * reality can be a little messier, as images can arrive from the user
 * with sizes that don't fit in the existing tree, or in an order
 * where the tree layout cannot be guessed immediately.  
 * 
 * This structure encodes an idealized mipmap tree.  The GL image
 * commands build these where possible, otherwise store the images in
 * temporary system buffers.
