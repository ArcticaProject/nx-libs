<H1>Help Wanted</H1>

<p>
We can always use more help with the Mesa project.
Here are some specific ideas and areas where help would be appreciated:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
    Generate the src/mesa/main/enums.c file with a Python script which
    uses the gl_API.xml file.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Try to auto-generate the display list "save" functions seen in dlist.c
    using a Python script and the gl_API.xml file.
    The gl_API.xml file will probably need a new tag to indicate whether or
    not each function gets compiled into display lists.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Maintenance of assembly language files on Linux, Windows and SPARC systems.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Help to incorporate the 3Dlabs' shading language compiler for OpenGL 2.0.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Implement assembly language (SSE/MMX) code generation for
    vertex/fragment programs.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Windows 98/NT driver building, maintenance and testing
    (Karl Schultz has been doing a great job of this lately).
    </p>
<li><p>
    Maintenance and testing of various drivers, such as DOS/DJGPP, GGI, etc.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Write new tests for Glean.
    </p>
</ol>


<p>
If you want to help with Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.
Then post a message to propose what you want to do, just to make sure
there's no issues.
</p>

</p>
Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project.
By doing so, it's assumed that you agree to the code's licensing terms.
</p>

<p>
Finally:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Try to write high-quality code that follows the existing style.
<li>Use uniform indentation, write comments, use meaningful identifiers, etc.
<li>Test your code thoroughly.  Include test programs if appropriate.
</ol>
