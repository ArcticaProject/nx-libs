 * \file dri_util.h
 * DRI utility functions definitions.
 *
 * This module acts as glue between GLX and the actual hardware driver.  A DRI
 * driver doesn't really \e have to use any of this - it's optional.  But, some
 * useful stuff is done here that otherwise would have to be duplicated in most
 * drivers.
 * 
 * Basically, these utility functions take care of some of the dirty details of
 * screen initialization, context creation, context binding, DRM setup, etc.
 *
 * These functions are compiled into each DRI driver so libGL.so knows nothing
 * about them.
