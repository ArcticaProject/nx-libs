/*
	The original TIntermTraverser class that is used to walk the intermediate tree,
	is not very elegant in its design. One must define static functions with
	appropriate prototypes, construct TIntermTraverser object, and set its member
	function pointers to one's static functions. If traversal-specific data
	is needed, a new class must be derived, and one must up-cast the object
	passed as a parameter to the static function.

	The class below eliminates this burden by providing virtual methods that are
	to be overridden in the derived class.
