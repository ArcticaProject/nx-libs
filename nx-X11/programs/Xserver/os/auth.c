    /*
     * We think that the way LoadAuthorization() is working is wrong.
     * It doesn't reset the list of stored authorizations before reading
     * the new cookies. Our take is that if a new auth file is to be
     * read, the only cookies that are to be accepted are those that are
     * in the new file, not those in the file -plus- those that have
     * been in the file in the past. Furthermore, if the list can't be
     * read or it is empty, it should assume that it ignores which co-
     * okies are valid and thus it should disable any access. Your mile-
     * age can vary. A less draconian approach could be to leave the old
     * cookies if the file can't be read and remove them only if the
     * file is empty.
     *
     * Adding the cookies without removing the old values for the same
     * protocol has an important implication. If an user shares the co-
     * okie with somebody and later wants to revoke the access to the
     * display, changing the cookie will not work. This is especially
     * important with NX. For security reasons, after reconnecting the
     * session to a different display, it is advisable to generate a
     * new set of cookies, but doing that it is useless with the current
     * code, as the old cookies are going to be still accepted. On the
     * same topic, consider that once an user has got access to the X
     * server, he/she can freely enable host authentication from any
     * host, so the safe behaviour should be to reset the host based
     * authenthication at least at reconnection, and keep as valid only
     * the cookies that are actually in the file. This behaviour would
     * surely break many applications, among them a SSH connection run
     * inside a NX session, as ssh -X reads the cookie for the display
     * only at session startup and does not read the cookies again
     * when the auth file is changed.
     *
     * Another bug (or feature, depending on how you want to consider
     * it) is that if the authority file contains entries for different
     * displays (as it is the norm when the authority file is the default
     * .Xauthority in the user's home), the server will match -any- of
     * the cookies, even cookies that are not for its own display. This 
     * means that you have be careful when passing an authority file to
     * nxagent or Xnest and maybe keep separate files for letting nxagent
     * find the cookie to be used to connect to the remote display and
     * for letting it find what cookies to accept. If the file is the
     * same, clients will be able to connect to nxagent with both the
     * cookies.
