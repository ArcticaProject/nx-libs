/*
 * This file is a reduced version of the header file of
 * <X11/extensions/Xrandr.h>
 *
 * This copy of code has been introduced to allow a clear namespace
 * separation between <X11/...> and <nx-X11/...> header files.
 *
 * This version of the Xrandr library header file only contains symbols
 * required by nxagent and strictly avoids indirectly including
 * from an X11 library that is also shipped in nx-X11/lib/.
 *
 * When using <X11/extensions/Xrandr.h> instead for inclusion in
 * nxagent, it will attempt pulling in the <X11/extensions/Xrender.h>
 * header which in turn will include <X11/Xlib.h>. However, the headers of
 * the same name from <nx-X11/...> should be used instead.
 *
 * FIXME: Once the nxagent Xserver starts using libXrender from X.Org, this
 * hack can be removed.
 *
 * 2015/06/26, Mike Gabriel <mike.gabriel@das-netzwerkteam.de>
