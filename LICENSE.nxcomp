==============================================================================

Update 2015-05-21 on the nature of the original DXPC license: The
original DXPC code used to be available under a license which failed to
explicitly grant the permission to modify, but was later retroactively
re-licensed under the 2-clause BSD license (see
doc/nxcomp/README.on-retroactive-DXPC-license for the copyright owners'
statements; also see <https://bugs.debian.org/784565> for more details).

In the course of discussion, it also became evident that Gian Filippo
Pinzari never participated in any of the official DXPC releases, but
rather worked on the forked code on the NoMachine side. Thus, we
crossed-out his name in the above copyright notice and moved him to the
top list of copyright holders associated with the GPL-2 re-licensing done
by NoMachine.

Thus, the version of DXPC where NXCOMP got forked from (most likely some
DXPC version between release 3.7.0 and release 3.8.0) can be considered
as BSD-2-clause, as quoted below:
