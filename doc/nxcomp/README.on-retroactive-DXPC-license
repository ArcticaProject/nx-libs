On DXPC retroactive relicensing as BSD-2-clause
===============================================

TL;DR; In May 2015, all versions of DXPC released before version 3.8.1 (sometime
in 2002) have retroactively been re-licensed by all previous maintainers
of DXPC as BSD-2-clause.

This README file gives an overview of the discussion thread that lead to
the retroactive re-licensing of DXPC.

For the full discussion, see doc/DXPC_re-licensed_debug_784565.mbox in
this source project or #784565 on the Debian bug tracker [1].

STEP 1
======

In May 2015, a serious license issue around the nxcomp code shipped in
this source project was raised and solved on the Debian bug tracker (thanks to
Francesco Poli and many others): http://bugs.debian.org/784565

I noticed that the debian/copyright states:

[...]

This license lacks the permission to modify the DXPC code.
Hence, the original DXPC code does not appear to comply with the
DFSG. And the nx-libs-lite is in part derived from DXPC code.

This basically means that nx-libs-lite includes parts which are
non-free (as they are derived from non-modifiable code) and
are also possibly legally undistributable (as they are non-modifiable,
but actually modified). The combination with the rest of nx-libs-lite
(which is GPL-licensed) may also be legally undistributable (since
the license with no permission to modify is GPL-incompatible).


If there's anything I misunderstood, please clarify.

Otherwise, please address this issue as soon as possible.
The copyright owners for the original DXPC code should be
contacted and persuaded to re-license under GPL-compatible
terms.
"""

The issue has been settled by asking all recent maintainers (i.e.,
copyright holders) of DXPC, to agree on considering the BSD-2-clause
license (as introduced in DXPC 3.8.1) retro-actively as the license of
all pre-3.8.1 DXPC releases.

STEP 2:
=======

Kevin Vigor, the (at that time being) latest known maintainer of DXPC
replied back immediately and provided the info given below. He also
stated that he agrees to applying BSD-2-clause retroactively to all
pre-3.8.1 releases of DXPC.

Subject: Re: Bug#784565: nx-libs-lite: parts are derived from non-free code

Hi Mike, et al,

   I am not the original author of dxpc, that being Brian Pane. However,
   I took over maintenance circa 1999 and am still the primary maintainer
   (though the project has effectively been dead for most of a decade
   now).

   As you are aware, when I inherited the code, it was licensed under a
   variant of the BSD license that did not include the 'with
   modification' clause. To the best of my recollection, somebody from
   the FSF contacted me circa 2001 regarding this and as a result,
   subsequent releases were done under a standard 2-clause BSD license
   with the modification clause. Again, to the best of my recollection, I
   contacted Brian about this change and he offered no objection.

   Further, I recall distinctly that NoMachine contacted me and
   explicitly asked permission before including DXPC code in NX, which I
   happily granted with no new conditions beyond the BSD license already
   in play.

   It is possible, though by no means certain, that I could dig up
   ancient email to corroborate this account if necessary. However, I am
   more than willing to publicly state that I believe NoMachine's use of
   DXPC code to be both legal and ethical, and that my intent when
   changing the license to 2-clause BSD was simply to clarity the
   existing intent and that it ought therefore be considered retroactive.

   Yours,
      Kevin Vigor

STEP 3:
-------

We were not able to dig out any recent mail address of Zachary Volner,
another of the DXPC copyright holders, but a phone number.

On Friday, May 15th, I (Mike Gabriel) called that phone number and left a
message on - hopefully - Zach's voicebox, asking him to mail me, so I
could explain everything. He mailed back and later on posted the below
statement to the Debian BTS, also expressing his agreement to the
retroactive re-licensing of DXPC.

Yes, I am fine with considering the license change to be retroactive to
cover the time I was the maintainer.

I have no objections to others distributing modified versions of that code.

STEP 4:
-------

By 18th May 2015, Brian Pane had not mailed back to us. Hoping he is well
and alive. Giving my personal gratitude to him for his work on DXPC back
in the nighties.

However, Kevin found an old archive of the DXPC mailing lists, esp. a
post by Brian expressing openness to modifications of all DXPC code
versions.

We refer to this regarding his consent on the re-licensing.

By the way, poking around the interwebs I find there is an archive of the old DXPC mailing list available at:

I think you will find this of particular interest:

The copyright banner in the Readme is all the documentation there's ever
been.  My intent was to allow _any_ distribution, use, and modification
of the source, without imposing restrictions on the licensing style of
any system into which others might incorporate the code.  We probably
should start stating this clearly in the distributions.

STEP 5:
-------

Last but not least, Kevin informed us that Gian Filippo Pinzari never
contributed any code to any of the official DPXC releases. So we assumed
that his copyrights on the code stem from the time where he - under the
NoMachine umbrella - worked on the code and should probably be associated
with the GPL-2 re-licensing of the code later on done by NoMachine
(which we did in the LICENSE file).

It also appears, that there has been an incongruity between the copyright
statement in nxcomp/Misc.cpp and nxcomp/LICENSE for Gian Filippo Pinzari.
We used the copyright years (2000,2003) from nxcomp/Misc.cpp instead of
those originally given in nxcomp/LICENSE (2000,2006).

I can confirm that Gian Fillippo never contributed directly to DXPC.
You'll note his name does not appear in the DXPC README, and never has.
