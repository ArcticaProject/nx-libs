                                  Abstract

     These release notes contains information about features and their
     status in the X.Org Foundation X11R6.9/X11R7.0 release.  It is
     based on the XFree86 4.4RC2 RELNOTES document published by The
     XFree86[tm] Project, Inc.  There are significant updates and dif-
     ferences in the X.Org release as noted below.

1.  Introduction to the X11R6.9/X11R7.0 Release

This release constitutes the first major version release of the X Window Sys-
tem in over a decade.  The main reasons for the major version bump from 6 to
7 is that we have moved from what has traditionally been a source codebase
comprised of many different components brought together into a single mono-
lithic tree to a source codebase where each of those same components found in
the monolithic tree are now split into logical modules that can be developed,
built and maintained separately, but still fit together coherently into the
larger project.  At the same time, we have moved away from the imake build
system to an autotools build system.  By making these changes we have opened
the source code up to a new generation of developers that can continue to
build upon the long tradition of the X Window System.

The reason for having simultaneous releases for both the monolithic and modu-
lar trees is to allow for a transition period as developers, builders and
vendors incorporate the significant changes to how the tree is built and
developed into their products and to allow time for additional platforms to
be supported the modular tree.  This initial modular release has support for
Linux and Solaris.  During the transition period, we expect both the mono-
lithic and modular trees to coexist.  For the monolithic tree, we expect that
there will be maintenance releases in the X11R6.8.x and X11R6.9.x series as
needed.  However, the main development effort will move over to the new modu-
lar tree.

The X11R7.0 release is the first in the modular series.  One of the advan-
tages of the modular tree is that it allows for more rapid and independent
updates of module components, so full maintenance releases will no longer be
required for simple bug fixes.  Rather, each module component maintainer can
prepare new releases as needed.  These module component releases will then be
periodically "rolled up" into official X.Org Foundation releases.  The next
official release will be X11R7.1 and is expected in mid 2006.

For more information on the modularization effort see the Modularization Pro-
posal <URL:http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularizationProposal>, and for help with
how to build and develop in the new modular tree see Modular Developer's
Guide <URL:http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide>.

We encourage you to submit bug fixes and enhancements to freedesktop.org's
bug tracking system <URL:https://bugs.freedesktop.org/> using the xorg prod-
uct, and to discuss them on <xorg@lists.freedesktop.org>.

The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.  X11
refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window system is
based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been stable for 17
years, with only upward compatible additions to the core X protocol, a record
of stability envied in computing.  Formal releases of X started with X ver-
sion 9 from MIT; the first commercial X products were based on X version 10.
The MIT X Consortium and its successors, the X Consortium, the Open Group X
Project Team, and the X.Org Group released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6,
before the founding of the X.Org Foundation in early 2004.

The next section describes what is new in the latest version (6.9/7.0) com-
pared with the previous full release (6.8).  The other sections below
describe some of the new features and changes between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There
are lots of new features, and we definitely don't have enough space to cover
them all here.

2.  Summary of new features in X11R6.9 and X11R7.0

This is a sampling of the new features in X11R6.9/X11R7.0.  A more complete
list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file that is part of the X
source tree.

   o EXA support included

     EXA is a new accleration architecture to replace XAA, the current archi-
     tecture.  It is largely based upon KAA in KDrive, and is far more effi-
     cient at accelerating typical workloads on modern hardware, particularly
     involving the RENDER extension.

   o FreeType was updated to version 2.1.9. But installing FreeType from X
     distributions would often or usually result in the replacement or use of
     "stale" versions of FreeType. On Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris 10, and SCO5,
     therefore, X11R6.9 will by default use the version of FreeType2 that is
     installed on the system. If your system doesn't come with an installed
     FreeType2 and you wish to use the version supplied with this distribu-
     tion, please add:

     #define HasFreetype2 NO

     to config/cf/host.def.

   o Updated Mesa and DRI from upstream sources

        o More OpenGL extensions

        o Support for Radeon r3xx/r4xx and PCI-Express chips

        o Support for mixed 32-bit and 64-bit clients on 64-bit machines.

   o Individual extensions may be enabled or disabled on the command line
     using the -extension flag

   o Improved chipset probing for IA64

   o SecureRPC enabled on Linux by default

   o Updated XRX support

   o Fixes to rootless mode for Cygwin and Darwin ports

   o Numerous K&R-to-ANSI C conversions

   o Many Darwin fixes

   o Updated XvMC support, enabling generic loading of hardware-specific
     drivers

   o Added wsfb video driver for OpenBSD and NetBSD framebuffer consoles

   o Numerous ATI driver updates from the GATOS project, including TV input
     support

     <URL:http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html>

   o Added evdev input driver for generic input handling on Linux

   o Switched to libdl-based module loader

   o MMX blending routines for the Render extension

   o Initial support for running the Xorg server without root privileges

   o Add DragonFly BSD support

   o SGI Altix support

   o Support for FreeBSD/powerpc

   o Enhanced software Render core

   o Include stack backtraces in logfiles when server crashes on glibc and
     Solaris systems

   o Multiseat support

   o xload made compatible with 64-bit kernels on Solaris

   o Bundled Mesa upgraded to 6.4.1

   o CAN-2005-2495 security fixes

   o Shared libraries now built for libXau and libXdmcp

   o GNU/kFreeBSD support

2.1  Updated keyboard mappings

The requirement for XKB data can, in the modular tree, be satisfied either by
the traditional data set (the 'xkbdata' module), or by the dataset from the
xkeyboard-config project (the 'xkbdesc' module).  xkbdesc has numerous
improvements relative to xkbdata: layouts have been cleaned up for consis-
tency and universal multi-layout support, some new layouts have added, and
some layouts have changed names to be more straightforward and ISO compliant.
Some setups will need adjustments in order to use xkbdesc.

2.2  New loader mechanism

The loader now uses the standard libdl-based loader, instead of implementing
its own ELF loading and parsing mechanism.  This extends loadable server sup-
port to many platforms where it was not previously possible, such as MIPS,
Motorola 68000, HP PA/RISC, et al.  The core loader itself has also been sig-
nificantly optimised.

4.  Overview of X11R6.9 and X11R7.0

On most platforms, X11R6.9/X11R7.0 has a single X server binary called Xorg.
This binary can either have one or more video and input drivers linked in
statically, or more usually, dynamically, and in that manner load the video
drivers, input drivers, and other modules that are needed.

X11R6.9 has X server support for most UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems
on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs on Alpha,
PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on PowerPC.
X11R7.0 has X server currently has support for Linux and Solaris, and is
expected to have other platform support in X11R7.1.

4.1  Loader and Modules

The X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load normal object
files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.  The loader does
not rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader support and it works
on platforms that do not provide this feature.  This  allows  for the modules
to be operating system independent (although not, of course, CPU architecture
independent) which means that a module compiled on Linux/x86 can be loaded by
an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not need to
be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader in version
6.9/7.0 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC platforms.  It also
has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb, cfb,
etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject to
change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibil-
ity for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules
will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.
Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new
modules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.

Note about module security

     The X server runs with root privileges, i.e., the X server loadable
     modules also run with these privileges.  For this reason we recom-
     mend that all users be careful to only use loadable modules from
     reliable sources,  otherwise the introduction of viruses and con-
     taminated code can occur and wreak havoc on your system.  We hope
     to have a mechanism for signing/verifying the modules that we pro-
     vide available in a future release.

4.2  Configuration File

The X server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism for providing
configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration file format is
described in detail in the xorg.conf(5) manual page.

This release comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xorgcfg",
which also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial
configuration file. It can also be used to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the Xorg server's
ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:

     Xorg -configure

 and follow the instructions.

Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool "xorgcon-
fig" can also be used for generating X server config files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will give you
a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration file.  With the
automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't need one!

If you do need to customize the configuration file, see the xorg.conf manual
page.  You can also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related
documentation (found at tables below (section , page ) also.

4.3  Command Line Options

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the Xorg(1) manual page.

4.4  XAA

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten from
scratch for XFree86 4.x and is used in X11R6.9/X11R7.0.  Most drivers imple-
ment acceleration by making use of the XAA module.  The Xorg server will
accept modules built either for XFree86 4.4 servers or its own.

4.5  Multi-head

Some multi-head configurations are supported in X11R6.9/X11R7.0, primarily
with multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising cards
that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved somewhat with
the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which allows secondary card
to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are other issues that still need
to be resolved.  Some combinations can be made to work better by changing
which card is the primary card (either by using a different PCI slot, or by
changing the system BIOS's preference for the primary card).

4.6  Xinerama

Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens to
behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11, windows can-
not span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this limitation.  Xin-
erama does, however, require that the physical screens all have the same root
depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use an 8-bit screen together
with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the +xinerama
command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in X11R6.9/X11R7.0
was completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.

Known problems:

   o Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some operations like
     window placement and resizing might not behave in an ideal way.  This is
     an issue that needs to be dealt with in the individual window managers,
     and isn't specifically an X server problem.

4.7  DGA version 2

DGA 2.0 is included in 6.9/7.0.  Documentation for the client libraries can
be found in the XDGA(3) man page.  A good degree of backwards compatibility
with version 1.0 is provided.

4.8  DDC

The VESA Display Data Channel (DDC[tm]) standard allows the monitor to tell
the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about itself; partic-
ularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section entry:
Option "NoDDC".  We have support for DDC versions 1 and 2; these can be dis-
abled independently with Option "NoDDC1" and Option "NoDDC2".

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and can
use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to warn about
monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file don't match
those that are detected.

4.8.1  Changed behavior caused by DDC.

Several drivers uses DDC information to set the screen size and pitch.  This
can be overridden by explicitly resetting it to the and non-DDC default value
75 with the -dpi 75 command line option for the X server, or by specifying
appropriate screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor"
section of the config file.

4.9  GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)

Direct rendered OpenGL support is provided for several hardware platforms by
the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information about DRI can
be found at the DRI Project's web site <URL:http://dri.sf.net/>.  The 3D core
rendering component is provided by Mesa <URL:http://www.mesa3d.org>.

4.10  XVideo Extension (Xv)

The XVideo extension is supported in X11R6.7.x.  An XvQueryPortAttributes
function has been added as well as support for XvImages.  XvImages are XIm-
ages in alternate color spaces such as YUV and can be passed to the server
through shared memory segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with
high quality hardware scaling and filtering.

4.11  X Rendering Extension (Render)

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more closely
matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides a render-
ing model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image composition rather
than binary raster operations.

Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render can draw
anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform translucent image
overlays and other image operations not possible with the core X rendering
system.

Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for Render applications.

4.11.1  The Xft Library

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for applications
using the FreeType library, version 2.  One important thing to note is that
Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor to compute accurate pixel sizes for
provided point sizes; if your monitor doesn't provide accurate information
via DDC, you may want to add that information to xorg.conf.

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text render-
ing to the Render extension, Xft can use either the core rendering requests
or the Render extension for text.  See the section on FreeType support in Xft
for instructions on configuring X11R6.9/X11R7.0 to use an existing FreeType
installation.

The Xft library uses configuration files, /etc/fonts/fonts.conf and
/etc/fonts/local.conf, which contains information about which directories
contain font files and also provides a sophisticated font aliasing mechanism.
Documentation for that file is included in the Xft(3) man page.

4.11.2  Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text

Only four applications have been modified in X11R6.9/X11R7.0 to work with the
Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide anti-aliased
text: xterm, xditview, x11perf and xclock.  Migration of other applications
may occur in future releases.

By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has a
command line option and associated resource to direct it to use Xft instead:

   o -fa family / .VT100.faceName: family.  Selects the font family to use.

Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf includes
tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, anti-
aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky text, but
through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat slower than
core text.

Xclock uses the Render extension to draw the analog face and shares the -fa
option and faceName resources with xterm to select a font for the digital
mode.

4.12  Other extensions

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server archi-
tecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported to
the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further work,
and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has support for
changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this is possible.
The xgamma utility makes use of this feature.  Compatibility with the 3.3.x
version of the extension is provided.  The missing parts of this extension
and some new features should be completed in a future release.

4.13  xedit

Xedit has several new features, including:

   o An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.

   o Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and
     Lisp.

   o Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.

   o Please refer to xedit(1) for more details.

   o XPrint support.

4.14  Font support

Details about the font support in X11R6.9.x/X11R7.0.x can be found in the
README.fonts document.

4.15  TrueType support

X11R6.7 came with two TrueType backends.  The functionality from the `X-True-
Type' backend has been integrated into the `FreeType' backend which is
designed to transparently support all of the functionality from the `X-True-
Type' backend with the exception of the font encoding libraries; the
`FreeType' backend uses only the fontenc-based encoding system .

4.16  CID font support

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in X11R6.9/X11R7.0 The CID-keyed font
format was designed by Adobe Systems <URL:http://www.adobe.com> for fonts
with large character sets.  The CID-keyed font support in X11R6.9/X11R7.0 was
donated by SGI <URL:http://www.sgi.com>.  See the LICENSE document for a copy
of the CID Font Code Public License.

4.17  Internationalisation of the scalable font backends

X11R6.9/X11R7.0 has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the scalable font backends
to use a common method of font re-encoding.  This re-encoding makes it possi-
ble to uses fonts in encodings other than their their native encoding.  This
layer is used by the Type1 and FreeType backends.

4.18  Large font optimisation

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font have
access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant memory con-
sumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is transmitted in a
compressed format.

4.19  Unicode/ISO 10646 support

What is included in X11R6.9/X11R7.0

   o All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the ISO10646-1
     encoding and cover at least the 614 characters found in ISO
     8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The non-bold fonts also cover
     all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4) characters, including those found in all
     8-bit MS-DOS/Windows code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-
     fixed-*'' BDF fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
     automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

   o Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a comprehensive
     Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters including all Latin, Greek,
     Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian, Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus
     numerous scientific, typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
     symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian, Thai,
     Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13 font there is
     now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18 font there is a 18x18ja
     Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554)
     characters. The 9x18 font can also be used to implement simple combining
     characters by accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus
     Kuhn's UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ <URL:http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/uni-
     code.html>.

   o Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer Modern).

   o ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm (enabled with the
     -u8 option).

   o The Freetype backend (the "freetype" module) supports Unicode-encoded
     fonts.

4.20  Xlib Compose file support and extensions

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
X11R6.9/X11R7.0.  The compose file is searched for in the following order:

  1.  If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its value is used as
      the name of the Compose file.

  2.  If the user's home directory has a file named ".XCompose", it is used
      as the Compose file.

  3.  The old method is used, and the compose file is "<xlocaledir>/<locale-
      name>/Compose".

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local modi-
fications to be made to existing compose files without including all of the
content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file can be
included with a line like this:

     include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"

There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the include
instruction.  %H expands to the user's home directory (the $HOME environment
variable), and %L expands to the name of the locale specific Compose file
(i.e., "<xlocaledir>/<localename>/Compose").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file by
using:

     include "%L"

and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a
locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is omit-
ted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current locale.
I.e., if a rule looks like:

     <dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave

the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.  But
if the rule is:

     <dead_grave> <A> : Agrave

the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

4.21  Bitstream Vera fonts

X11R6.9 includes the Bitstream Vera family of typefaces in TrueType format.
This family includes the ``Bitstream Vera Sans'', ``Bitstream Vera Sans
Mono'' and ``Bitstream Vera Serif'' in Roman and Bold varients as well as the
``Bitstream Vera Sans'' and ``Bitstream Vera Sans Mono'' in Oblique and Bold
Oblique.  These fonts include all of the glyphs needed for ISO  8859 parts 1
9 and 15.

The license terms for the Vera fonts are inclued in the file COPYRIGHT.Vera>.

4.22  Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes

The X distribution includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type 1 fonts and TrueType
fonts.  This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi Serif'', ``Luxi Sans'' and
``Luxi Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and bold oblique variants.  The True-
Type version have glyphs covering the basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin 1
range, as well as the Extended Latin range and some additional punctuation
characters.  In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for
ISO 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the
Adobe Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type 1 versions is somewhat reduced, and only cov-
ers ISO 8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow from
Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs in Ikarus
digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted the Ikarus for-
mat fonts to TrueType and Type 1 font programs and implemented the grid-fit-
ting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file `COPYRIGHT.BH',
as well as in the License document.  For further information, please contact
<design@bigelowandholmes.com> or <info@urwpp.de>, or consult the URW++ web
site <URL:http://www.urwpp.de>.

5.  Miscellaneous

This section describes other items of note for the X11R6.9/X11R7.0 release.

5.1  Legacy keyboard driver phase-out

The legacy keyboard driver is no longer compiled into the X server by default
on certain platforms (including Linux).  The newer kbd driver replaces the
older built-in driver.  It is suggested that, if the X server says that it
cannot load the keyboard driver, then the xorg.conf file should be updated to
use the new kbd driver, which can be done by changing the Driver line in the
InputDevice section.  For example,

     Section "InputDevice"
             Identifier  "Keyboard0"
             Driver      "kbd"
     EndSection

Note that the driver name is case-sensitive.

5.2  Socket directory ownership and permissions

The socket directories created in /tmp are now required to be owned by root
and have their sticky-bit set.  If the permissions are not set correctly, the
component using this directory will print an error message and fail to start.
Common socket directories that are known to be affected include:

     /tmp/.font-unix
     /tmp/.ICE-unix
     /tmp/.X11-unix

These directories are used by the font server, xfs, applications using the
Inter-Client Exchange protocol (ICE) and the X server, respectively.

There are several solutions to the problem of when to create these directo-
ries.  They could be created at install time by the system's installer if the
/tmp dir is persistent.  They could be created at boot time by the system's
boot scripts (e.g., the init.d scripts).  Or, they could be created by PAM
modules at service startup or user login time.

The solution chosen is platform dependent, and the system administrator
should be able to handle creating those directories on any systems that do
not have the correct ownership or permissions.

5.3  Composite exposes extra visuals

When the Composite extension is enabled via xorg.conf or the command line, a
new visual is created.  This visual is different from the other visuals used
by X applications in that it includes an alpha component.  It is used by the
compositing manager and other Composite aware applications.

Most X applications ignore this visual since it is not useful to them; how-
ever some applications mistakenly try to use it, which will cause them to
fail.  An environment variable, XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS, was added to the X11
library to hide this visual from applications that mistakenly try to use it.
If an application fails only when the Composite is enabled, try setting this
environment variable before starting the application.

Since Composite is not enabled by default, it is not expected that this issue
will be visible to most users.

6.  Deprecated components and removal plans

This section lists current plans for removal of obsolete or deprecated compo-
nents in the X.Org releases.  As our releases are open source, users who con-
tinue to require these can find the source in previous releases and continue
to use these, but the X.Org Foundation and its volunteers have decided the
burden of continued maintenance and distribution in the core X11 releases
outweighs the benefits of doing so.  In some cases, this is simply because no
one has volunteered to do continued maintenance, so if software is listed
here that you need, you can contact <xorg@lists.freedesktop.org> to volunteer
to take over maintainership, either inside or outside of the Xorg release
process.

      Display Postscript (DPS)
            The DPS software is included and built by default (except as
            noted in README.dps) in the X.Org X11R6.8 release series.  The
            software will be included, but not built unless specifically con-
            figured by the builder, in the X.Org X11R6.9 release series.  At
            this time, X.Org does not plan to include any of the DPS software
            in X11R7.0 or later releases.  For more information, see xc/pro-
            grams/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/README.dps in the X.Org source
            release.
