-----------

1. Install a cross-compiler for ARM. You can find detailed
   informations at:

   http://www.ailis.de/~k/knowledge/crosscompiling/toolchain.php

   There are also binaries needed to install the cross-compiler.

2. Configure and compile nxproxy using:

   $ ./configure --with-ipaq
   $ make

   After compilation type:

   $ arm-linux-strip nxproxy

3. You need libXcomp.so to run nxproxy. Be sure you include the
   library in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For example, you can run:

   > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HOME/NX/nxcomp
   > nxproxy -S localhost:8

4. The package nxscripts contains many examples of NX usage that
   you can modify to suit your needs.
