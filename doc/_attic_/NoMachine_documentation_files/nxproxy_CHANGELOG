- Updated the file VERSION.

nxproxy-3.0.0-1

- Opened the 3.0.0 branch based on nxproxy-2.0.0-2.

nxproxy-2.0.0-2

- Updated copyright to year 2006.

nxproxy-2.0.0-1

- Opened the 2.0.0 branch based on nxproxy-1.5.0-10.

nxproxy-1.5.0-10

- Added the JPEG, PNG and Z libraries to the linker when compiling
  on Cygwin. GCC 3.3.x requires that these libraries are explicitly
  given while this is not required since GCC 3.4.x.

- Created a new configure using autoconf 2.59.

nxproxy-1.5.0-9

- Removed provision for dynamically loading a different version of
  the nxcomp library.

nxproxy-1.5.0-8

- Updated to reflect the new naming of the NX transport interfaces.

nxproxy-1.5.0-7

- Modified the Makefile.in to remove the *.out.* files generated by
  Valgrind when running a 'make clean'.

- Modified the README files and removed files that were outdated.

nxproxy-1.5.0-6

- Removed the NX_FORCE_IDLE_PROXY stubs.

nxproxy-1.5.0-5

- This version has NX_FORCE_IDLE_PROXY undefined, so it should work
  in a way that is compatible with the old nxproxy.

nxproxy-1.5.0-4

- This software is crafted by default to test the new integration
  between nxcomp and nxssh. The process will stay idle and will
  let nxssh create the proxy. Note that the session log will go to
  'sshlog', not to 'session'. This will have to be fixed in nxcomp
  in future versions.

- Removed the references to the "bind" functionality that is not
  used in the current software.

nxproxy-1.5.0-3

- Added a NX_FORCE_IDLE_PROXY. If set, nxproxy will stay idle and
  will not try to create a nxcomp proxy. This is used for testing
  the new in-process nxcomp functionalities with the development
  versions of nxclient and nxssh software.

nxproxy-1.5.0-2

- Small changes to this file.

nxproxy-1.5.0-1

- Opened the 1.5.0 branch.

nxproxy-1.4.1-1

- Opened the 1.4.1 branch.

nxproxy-1.4.0-3

- We were lucky. We found a machine where nxproxy failed exactly
  in the same way described by multiple users in their reports.
  The error was the same ('dlopen: win32 line 126') and neither
  rebasing the Cygwin DLLs or removing all the other Cygwin li-
  braries worked. So the problem had necessarily to be in a bug-
  gy Cygwin dlopen() implementation. To solve this I had to make
  changes to the nxproxy code on Windows, so it links to nxcomp
  at compile time in the way specified below. As far as I can
  tell, any other way fails. This seems to be another Cygwin bug:
  the linker says that everything is OK but then the executable
  can't be run. Both the Cygwin's bash and the command.com say
  'Permission denied'.

  LIBS = -L../nxcomp -lstdc++ -Wl,-e,_mainCRTStartup -lXcomp \
         -lcygipc -static -lpng -static -ljpeg -lz

nxproxy-1.4.0-2

- Added a Binder class invoked when calling proxy with -B option.
  It would serve as a replacement of the modifications I'm doing
  in nxssh. The class is just a framework and the implementation
  is unfinished.

- Solved a potential problem in Main.c with NXExit() being called
  after the dlclose(). This was unlikely to happen as proxy never
  returns.

nxproxy-1.4.0-1

- Opened the 1.4.0 branch.

nxproxy-1.3.2-1

- Opened the 1.3.2 branch.

nxproxy-1.3.1-2

- Removed the underline characters and added a colon in the
  title of this ChangeLog to fully comply with format used in
  the release notices.

nxproxy-1.3.1-1

- Opened the 1.3.1 branch.

nxproxy-1.3.0-7

- Added a check on the OS version when running on MacOS/X.
  Versions 10.2 and 10.3 differ in the way names are mangled.

- Fixed error detection on dlsym(). The previous code was not
  able to correctly identify missing symbols.

nxproxy-1.3.0-6

- Modified configure.in to compile under FreeBSD.

nxproxy-1.3.0-5

- Fixed a (further) compilation problem under Cygwin.

nxproxy-1.3.0-4

- New nxproxy is able to load libXcomp by dlopen() under
  Cygwin. This simplifies both code in Main.c and the
  configure.in script.

- Changed configure.in to not link with -mwindows under
  Cygwin. Linking with -mwindows prevented stderr to be
  correctly output when running nxproxy on a console.

nxproxy-1.3.0-3

- Changed configure.in to first check for nx-X11 includes
  and libraries. Added "/usr/openwin/bin/makedepend" to
  path searched for the executable.

nxproxy-1.3.0-2

- Small cleanup in configure.in. A new configure script has
  been generated using autoconf-2.57-3.

nxproxy-1.3.0-1

- Updated internal version, so this release tries to load
  libXcomp version 1.3.0.
