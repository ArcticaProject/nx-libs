  available fd exhausted. This bug was caused by a function in font
  library not closing the file before a return on error breaking the
  flow of normal execution.

- Fixed TR06G02225. The implementation of Xvprintf() has been reviewed
  to work on more platforms. Previous implementation caused a failure
  in the build of keyboard map on some platform like Solaris 8 and 9.

- Fixed TR03G02198. Reimplemented Xvprintf() in Xserver/os to handle
  the case in which vsnprintf returned -1.

- Returning from _XSeqSyncFunction() and _XReply() if an I/O error is
  detected.

nx-X11-3.3.0-5

- Fixed TR01G02163. Signals need to be blocked before the call to
  fork() in the Popen() utility.
 
- Fixed TR01G02164. Trapezoid data need to be validated before use.
  This issue was the same of CVE-2007-2437.

nx-X11-3.3.0-4

- Changed the copyright attribution from Medialogic to NoMachine.

nx-X11-3.0.0-31

- Make SmartScheduleStopTimer() visible outside Xserver/os/utils.c
  so that it can be called by the agent. Export the declaration in
  dixstruct.h. 

nx-X11-3.0.0-30

- The OsVendorVErrorFFatal flag is set to 1 if the function pointed
  by OsVendorVErrorFProc is called due to a fatal error.

- Give the possibility to the agent to redirect the standard error
  during a Popen() or a System() by setting the OsVendorStartRedir-
  ectErrorFProc and OsVendorEndRedirectErrorFProc function pointers.

nx-X11-3.0.0-29

- Changed the default message printed on a fatal server error. The
  new message is:

  Error: Aborting session with 'Error text...'.

- Hacked LogVWrite() to force all fatal error messages to have an
  uppercase initial. Also remove the trailing newline and the full-
  stop, if present.

nx-X11-3.0.0-28

- Corrected the typos in the ChangeLog.

nx-X11-3.0.0-27

- Fixed the cleanup of the X_RenderCompositeText16 padding bytes.

- More code cleanup in the NX changes to the Xrender library.

- Changed host.def to build the freetype and fontconfig libraries
  if the agent server is also built. Freetype is built as a shared
  library: this avoids the link error on 64 bit platforms.

nx-X11-3.0.0-26

- Applied the following security patches, from the X.Org security
  advisory, April 3rd, 2007 "Multiple vulnerability in X server,
  libXfont and libX11":

  xorg-xserver-1.2.0-xcmisc.diff
  xorg-libXfont-1.2.7-bdf-fontdir.diff
  xorg-libX11-1.1.1-xinitimage.diff

nx-X11-3.0.0-25

- Added the missing *.X.original file for ChkIfEv.c and Xlib.h.

nx-X11-3.0.0-24

- Changed Xrender to clean up the padding bytes in XRenderComposite-
  Text functions.

- Added function XRenderCleanGlyphs() cleaning the padding bytes in
  the data section of RenderAddGlyphs requests.

nx-X11-3.0.0-23

- Removed the additional parameter from the call to NXTransFlush()
  in _XReply().

- Call NXTransExit() on AbortServer() (called by FatalError()) to
  give the proxy a chance to shut down the NX transport.

nx-X11-3.0.0-22

- Moved the replacement of XCheckIfEvent() ChkIfEv.c with the name
  XCheckIfEventNoFlush().

nx-X11-3.0.0-21

- Set BUFSIZE to 8192 bytes. While the output buffer size can be
  configured by setting the XLIBBUFFERSIZE in the environment (see
  OpenDis.c), this constant is still used when reading from the
  socket.

nx-X11-3.0.0-20

- If set, the handler pointed by _NXDisplayWriteFunction is called
  after that more data is written to the display connection.

nx-X11-3.0.0-19

- Added a RejectWellKnownSockets() stub to make possible to compile
  the agent when the NX transport is disabled.

- Added more useful logs to _XWaitForWritable().

nx-X11-3.0.0-18

- Changed Imakefile of X11 and Xserver in order to build nxcompshad
  just before the NX agent server.

- Changed Imakefile in Xserver to add NXdamage.o to NXAGENTOBJS.

nx-X11-3.0.0-17

- Changed host.def in order to build Xdamage and Xrandr libraries.

- Changed host.def in order not to build NXWin.

nx-X11-3.0.0-16

- Changed host.def in order to build Xtst as a shared library.

nx-X11-3.0.0-15

- Changes to comply with nxcompshad library.

- Changed configuration to statically build Xtst library.

- Restored parser directory under Xserver/hw/xfree86.

nx-X11-3.0.0-14

- Changed the LICENSE file to state that the software is only made
  available under the version 2 of the GPL.

- Added file COPYING.

- In nx-X11/programs and nx-X11/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86, removed
  files and directories not needed to build servers.

nx-X11-3.0.0-13

- Changes aimed to link servers with static versions of Xdmcp and Xau
  libraries.

nx-X11-3.0.0-12

- Added references to implented FR in the ChangeLog.

- Removed nx-X11/fonts and nx-X11/doc directories. They are not needed
  for building the NX components.

nx-X11-3.0.0-11

- Updated the copyright notices to year 2007.

nx-X11-3.0.0-10

- Applied the following security patches:

   x11r6.9.0-cidfonts.diff 
   x11r6.9.0-dbe-render.diff
   x11r6.9.0-geteuid.diff
   x11r6.9.0-mitri.diff
   x11r6.9.0-setuid.diff

nx-X11-3.0.0-9

- Merged the NX changes to X11 with the X11R6.9.0 version of X.org.

nx-X11-3.0.0-8

- Changes to build Xshadow library when building X11.

- Changes to Xserver Imakefile to link Xshadow library.

- Changes to host.def in order to build on old distributions.

nx-X11-3.0.0-7

- Imported changes up to nx-X11-2.1.0-2

- Fixed TR08D01485. Updated rgb file paths validation in order to
  support Ubuntu distribution.

- Added Xtst to libraries to be linked by nxagent.

- Changed Xpm Imakefile to build a shared library on Solaris.

- Fixed build error on Solaris in xtrans.

- Changed host.def not to build Xnest server.

- Changed Xserver Imakefile to link nxaccess library.

nx-X11-3.0.0-6

- Added the path of nxaccess library to the server link command.

nx-X11-3.0.0-5

- Implemented FR10C01079 and FR10C01080. The merge of NX changes to
  the X.org code is complete.

- Merged changes in config/cf. The NX-*.def files have been dismissed.
  Main platform dependent configurations have been moved to host.def.

- Removed *.reference files from config/cf.

- Fixed compilation for Cygwin platform.

nx-X11-3.0.0-4

- Imported all changes up to nx-X11-2.0.0-32.

- Cleaned up lib/zlib directory.

- Added missing file programs/Xserver/os/utils.c.NX.original.

- Updated the copyright notice to year 2006.

- The pointer to the display buffer is reset after an I/O error.
  This prevents leaving the buffer in an inconsistent state if the
  error occurs inside _XFlush().

- Removed the modifications to the Xrender library. The cleanup of
  the padding bytes is now performed by the NX transport.

- NX uses the updated ZLIB from its build tree, so Imake.tmpl will
  now assume that the platform as ZLIB unless otherwise stated.

- The path of the SecurityPolicy file is searched and validated at
  runtime.

- Added the _X11TransSocketProxyConnInfo() function to Xtranssock.c
  It returns the pointer to the XtransConnInfo private, if it is a
  valid _NXProxyConnInfo structure.

- The above function is used by OpenDis.c to detect if the NX trans-
  port was requested on the display and avoid spurious error messa-
  ges in the case of a connection failure.

- Added NXmiwindow.o to the NXAGENTOBJS in the Xserver's Imakefile
  and imported NXmiwindow.c in nxagent. This allows us to check the
  pointer to the pOldClip region in miSetShape() before going on
  freeing it.

- The path of the XKB base directory and of the xkbcomp comand is
  validated at runtime.

- Also added a check to verify the validity of the rgb file path.

- Added NXresource.o to NXAGENTOBJS in the Imakefile of nxagent. We
  need this to a assign a resource to the pixmaps and other server
  objects which need to be enumerated at reconnection. Some objects,
  being created by the X server and not by the clients, don't pass
  through the resource assignment process operated by the dix. To
  ensure that all objects get a resource, we add a resource at the
  time the object is created and temporarily assign the resource to
  the server client. If the dix later assigns the resource to a va-
  lid client, the resource is removed from the server client's list.
  
- The display block handler registered by the client is called in
  WaitForReadable() and WaitForWritable() before every select(),
  not only upon entering the function. The reason is that more
  data can be possibly produced for the NX link by the proxy it-
  self and, when setting the flush policy to deferred, the client
  may not have the chance of flushing the NX link.

- Fixed a bug in XkbUseExtension() that caused Xlib to query the
  presence of the XKEYBOARD extension multiple times. This partial-
  ly implents the FR01D01275. The complete implementation required
  modifications to the X11 agent, implemented in nxagent-2.0.0-33.

- Updated to comply with the new NXTransFlush() interface.

- Both nxwin and nxagent now read the X authority file by using an
  fopen() instead of the system command 'cat'.

- Removed NXmiwindow.o from the NXAGENTOBJ list. The agent will now
  use the original miwindow.c.

- Added some additional logs in Xtranssock.c to follow the creation
  and removal of the X server's Unix listener.

- Avoided the sleep of 5 seconds forced by Xtransutil.c if the dir-
  ectory where the Unix listener is created is not owned by root.
  This sleep is not executed on Cygwin (where the X socket can be
  hardly owned by root) but may delay the startup of the agent if
  the user chose a different NX_TEMP directory. Furthermore, it is
  unclear what real benefits such sleeps are intended to bring to
  the security of the X server. This can be controlled by defining
  the NX_TRANS_SLEEP directive in Xserver/os/Imakefile.

- Added NXmiexpose.o to the NXAGENTOBJ.

- Ensured that _X11TransSocketCloseConnInfo() now initiates the NX
  shutdown by calling NXTransClose().

- Corrected a misplaced #else that made SocketUNIXConnect() skip a
  block if the connection was not to the NX transport.

- Updated to comply with the new NX function prototypes introduced
  in nxcomp-2.0.0-31.

- Moved the most important Xtranssock.c modifications into separate
  functions.

- Ensured that the modifications enabling the internal connections
  to the proxy are compiled only when the TRANS_CLIENT directive is
  defined.

- Solved a bug that prevented the X11 socket to be deleted at the X
  server shutdown. This needs further tests.

- Added nxcompext to the link of nxagent, now that the dependency
  of libX11 from nxcompext is removed.

- Improved the Xtranssock routines to never loop through the array
  of connection info.

- Added a congestion flag to the connection info structure and a
  function querying the transport and reporting if a change in the
  congestion state has occurred. The code is currently not enabled,
  because instead of polling the transport, we let the proxy notify
  the changes in congestion state by using the callback. The code
  can be used in future to extend the library, for example, by add-
  ing some counters tracking the bandwidth usage of the socket con-
  nection, so that we can make the congestion notifications work
  even with a plain X11 connection.

- Profiled the routines in XlibInt.c to reduce the number of calls
  to the error predicate function provided by the client.

- Fixed the nxcompext build problem that caused make World to fail.

- Added a 'CONF' target to the X11 and Xext Imakefiles so that the
  configure script is not run if the config.status exists.

- Added the _NXDisplayBlockHandler hook. The function is called by
  Xlib before blocking. The parameter says if Xlib is going to wait
  for more input or because it needs to write to the display  socket.
  The client can use the hook to perform any internal operation that
  may require some time to complete. The user, though, should not
  try to read or write to the display inside the callback routine.

- Removed the outdated NX_TRANS_PROCESS, NX_TRANS_THREAD and NX_TR-
  ANS_INCLUDE defines.

- Reverted the lib/Xext Imakefile to the original XF86 version and
  moved the build of the nxcompext library among the libX11 depend-
  encies.

- Corrected the lib/X11 Imakefile so that a new build of nxcomp and
  nxcompext is not attempted if the libraries are up-to-date.

- Removed the unused display buffer and image cleanup functions.
  
- Reverted the PutImage.c file to the original XF86 version.
  
- Added the _NXDisplayErrorPredicate function in XlibInt.c. It is
  actually a pointer to a function called whenever Xlib is going to
  perform a network operation. If the function returns true, the
  call will be aborted and Xlib will return the control to the ap-
  plication. It is up to the application to set the XlibDisplayIO-
  Error flag after the _NXDisplayErrorPredicate returns true. The
  function can be used to activate additional checks, besides the
  normal failures detected by Xlib on the display socket. For exam-
  ple, the application can set the funciton to verify if an inter-
  rupt was received or if any other event occurred mandating the
  end of the session.

- Modified XIfEvent(), XMaskEvent() and XPeekIfEvent() to check the
  _NXDisplayErrorPredicate function and return immediately if the
  function returns true.

- Modified _XWaitForReadable() to never enter the loop if the dis-
  play is broken.

- Corrected a make problem on Windows that caused the nxcomp and
  nxcompext libraries to be referred with the wrong name, with the
  result that a new configure and make was attempted at each build
  attempt.

- Merged all the changes to os, Xext, xkb, dix.

- Changed host.def to build only the agent server.

- Merged the changes to Xtranssock.c

nx-X11-3.0.0-3

- Merged the changes to lib/X11. Restored original PutImage.c and
  ClDisplay.c files.

nx-X11-3.0.0-2

- Created a directory named 'reference' to keep files that are chan-
  ged during the development of nx-X11 since the 1.5.0-16 to 2.0.0-32
  version. These files will be removed as long as the differences are
  merged to the 3.0.0 version. When all differences are merged, this
  directory will be removed.

nx-X11-3.0.0-1

- Opened the 3.0.0 branch based on the nx-X11-2.0.0-9. The 3.0.0
  branch will now support the migration toward the X.org tree. Due
  to time concerns, the 2.0.0 branch is going to be based on the
  same nx-X11 as the 1.5.0.

nx-X11-2.0.0-9

- Modified the agent link arguments to explicitly include the NX
  libraries.

- Disabled the Xinerama extension to avoid further clashes with
  the redefinition of GC in Xlib.

- Added os/libos.a at the end of the agent link.

nx-X11-2.0.0-8

- Moved the declarations of _NXEnable* and related structures from
  Xlibint.h to NXlibint.h.  

- Added provision for building the agent. This can be controlled by
  setting NXAgentServer to YES in host.def.

- Setting the NXUpgradeAgentServer variable to YES in the host.def
  file will make the agent assume that it is being built in the new
  environment. This variable is normally unset when building in the
  1.5.0 tree.

nx-X11-2.0.0-7

- Fixed a problem on AMD64 due to the size of the area pointed by
  the argument of _X11TransBytesReadable(). BytesReadable_t is long,
  at least on Linux, while the ioctl() requires a pointer to an int.
  The original _X11TransBytesReadable() function simply calls the
  ioctl() by passing the pointer that is provided. NXTransReadable(),
  instead, was correctly returning the value assuming a pointer to
  a long, but this crashes some applications, among them xterm. Now
  NXTransReadable() follows the same schema of the ioctl() call and
  stores the result assuming a pointer to an int.

- Removed the outdated NX_TRANS_PROCESS and NX_TRANS_THREAD code.

nx-X11-2.0.0-6

- Made xterm work with the NX transport. This required small changes
  to the Xt toolkit's and the xterm's files to let them use the NX
  aware select(). This is useful to test the NX transport until the
  nxagent server is integrated.

- When the transport is gone _X11TransSocketBytesReadable() returns
  EPIPE. This makes the client become aware of the closure of the
  connection.

- Added a call to NXTransDestroy() in XCloseDisplay().

- The exit() function in XlibInt.c causes a call to NXTransExit().

- Merged changes to dix/pixmap.c, xkb/xkbDflts.h, mi/Imakefile.

- Removed unneeded changes and files containing patches already in
  the latest X.org distribution: dix/dispatch.c, fb/fbcompose.c, fb/
  fbgc.c, xkb/ddxList.c, font/fontfile/dirfile.c, font/fontfile/
  encparse.c, font/fontfile/fontfile.c, font/FreeType/fttools.c,
  Xrender/FillRect.c, Xrender/Picture.c.

nx-X11-2.0.0-5

- Changes to the lib/X11/Imakefile to cleanly build the tree. This
  is obtained by creating a link to the Xcomp library in exports/lib
  without having to modify the programs' Imakefiles.

- Finished merging the NX changes in the lib/X11 files.

- Merged the CHANGELOG with the one from the 1.5.0 tree.

nx-X11-2.0.0-4

- Merged the NX changes in most Xtrans and lib/X11 files.

nx-X11-2.0.0-3

- Temporarily disabled the use of the MMX extensions in the Xserver's
  fb code to successfully compile with GCC 4.

nx-X11-2.0.0-2

- Imported the *.NX.reference and *.XF86.reference files that will
  be needed for the merge. These files are the *.original from the
  1.5.0 tree. They will be removed as long as the merge advances.

nx-X11-2.0.0-1

- Created the 2.0.0 branch based on X.org the 6.8.99.16 snapshot.

nx-X11-1.5.0-16

- Added the missing *.XF86.original and *.NX.original files.

nx-X11-1.5.0-15

- Made the nxagent server use select() instead of poll() on Solaris
  so that it can leverage the new NX transport.

- Moved the NXTransFlush() call to _XReply().

nx-X11-1.5.0-14

- Added the 'synchronous' parameter in the _XWaitForReadable() call
  to NXTransFlush().

nx-X11-1.5.0-13

- Removed the log entry in XlibInt.c on calling the NXTransFlush().

nx-X11-1.5.0-12

- Changed XlibInt.c and utils.c to call NXTransExit().

nx-X11-1.5.0-11

- Changed XlibInt.c to comply with the new NXTransFlush() interfa-
  ce introduced in nxcomp-1.5.0-42.

- Cosmetic changes to messages printed for debug.

nx-X11-1.5.0-10

- Ensured that all calls to _XIOError() are followed by a return.

- Put exiting the client program in the case of an I/O error under
  the control of the _NXContinueOnDisplayError flag. If set, the
  I/O error routine will simply return, leaving to the application
  the responsibility of checking the state of the XlibDisplayIOEr-
  ror flag.

- Added some checks whenever a read or write is performed on the X
  connection, so that we can exit the I/O loop if the X channel is
  gone. It is likely that more work will be needed when trying to
  support XTHREADS enabled connections. This should not be a pro-
  blem for now, as the default is still to quit the application un-
  less the _NXContinueOnDisplayError flag is explicitly set.

nx-X11-1.5.0-9

- Removed the references to the cygipc library in NXWin. Now use the
  cygserver daemon to provide the MIT-SHM extension.

- Fixed an error in the UseCygIPC definition.

- Changed the cygwin.cf file to avoid redefinition of the BuildGlxExt,
  XWinServer and BuildGlxExt symbols.

nx-X11-1.5.0-8

- Added provision for deferred writes in the NX transport. When en-
  tering _XWaitForReadable() we must ensure that data is flushed to
  the proxy link.

- Added the UseCygIPC define to NX-Cygwin.def.

- Updated the NoMachine copyright notice on the modified files.

nx-X11-1.5.0-7

- Added the GLX extension in NX-Sun.def.

- Added some more logs in WaitFor.c.

nx-X11-1.5.0-6

- Modified Xlibint.h and XlibInt.c to remove the _NXFlushSize para-
  meter. New agents run the NX transport in-process, so we don't get
  any benefit from increasing the display buffer size.

- Modified NX-Darwin.def to not build the NXDarwin server. Since the
  1.4.0 version the NXDarwin server is unsupported and the NX client
  for the Mac requires that the Apple X server is installed.

- Changed NX-Linux.def to avoid the warning due to "SharedLibGLw"
  being not defined.

nx-X11-1.5.0-5

- Modified the Xserver Imakefile to link nxagent with FbPostFbLibs
  and avoid including mfb/libmfb.a.

- Added the GLX extension in NX-Linux.def. This provides unaccelera-
  ted support in nxagent, with GLX operations translated into core X
  protocol primitives.

- Fixed x-X11/programs/Xserver/GL/dri/Imakefile to look in ../../hw/
  /xfree86/os-support/bus for includes.

nx-X11-1.5.0-4

- Avoid calling NXTransSelect() if the transport is gone, so that we
  don't have to wait until the timeout.

- Added the "-fno-strict-aliasing" option to linux.cf when compiling
  with a GCC version >= 4. In the words of Stefan Dirsch: "The opt-
  ion, which is default since gcc 3.1, can result in wrong code when
  the gcc warnings related to it are ignored. And as there are seve-
  ral warnings in X11 related to it, it has been disabled for X11
  from the beginning. This didn't change for gcc4, so it still needs
  to be used."

- Added more logs in XlibInt.c and utils.c. A warning is printed if
  the SmartScheduler is initialized.

nx-X11-1.5.0-3

- Started integration of nxcomp with the X libraries. The Xtrans
  code creates an internal connection to the nxcomp library instead
  of a child proxy process.

- Changed Xpoll.h and XlibInt.c to replace the standard Select
  with a version giving NX a chance to check its own descriptors.

- Implemented the NXTransReadVector() and the NXTransWriteVector()
  functions to replace READV() and WRITEV().

- Implemented memory-to-memory communication with the NX proxy by
  making use of the NXTransAgent() interface.

nx-X11-1.5.0-2

- We think that the way LoadAuthorization() is working is wrong.
  It doesn't reset the list of stored authorizations before reading
  the new cookies. Our take is that if a new auth file is to be
  read, the only cookies that are to be accepted are those that are
  in the new file, not those in the file -plus- those that have
  been in the file in the past. Furthermore, if the list can't be
  read or it is empty, it should assume that it ignores which co-
  okies are valid and thus it should disable any access. Your mile-
  age can vary. A less draconian approach could be to leave the old
  cookies if the file can't be read and remove them only if the
  file is empty.

  Adding the cookies without removing the old values for the same
  protocol has an important implication. If an user shares the co-
  okie with somebody and later wants to revoke the access to the
  display, changing the cookie will not work. This is especially
  important with NX. For security reasons, after reconnecting the
  session to a different display, it is advisable to generate a
  new set of cookies, but doing that it is useless with the current
  code, as the old cookies are going to be still accepted. On the
  same topic, consider that once an user has got access to the X
  server, he/she can freely enable host authentication from any
  host, so the safe behaviour should be to reset the host based
  authenthication at least at reconnection, and keep as valid only
  the cookies that are actually in the file. This behaviour would
  surely break many applications, among them a SSH connection run
  inside a NX session, as ssh -X reads the cookie for the display
  only at session startup and does not read the cookies again
  when the auth file is changed.

  Another bug (or feature, depending on how you want to consider
  it) is that if the authority file contains entries for different
  displays (as it is the norm when the authority file is the default
  .Xauthority in the user's home), the X server will match -any- of
  the cookies, even cookies that are not for its own display. This 
  means that you have to be careful when passing an authority file
  to nxagent and maybe keep separate files for letting nxagent find
  the cookie to be used to connect to the remote display and for
  letting it find what cookies to accept. If the file is the same,
  clients will be able to connect to nxagent with both the cookies.
  This bug obviously affects any X server, also the real X server
  running on the workstation, so it is common to see nxagent being
  able to connect to the X server even if no cookie matches the
  real display.

- Added a check in lib/Xau/AuRead.c to prevent the fread() call to
  be interrupted by SIGCHLD while reading the auth file. Due to the
  way the old code worked, this could lead to the server enabling
  local host access to the display. This problem had been identified
  in the past. We just found that all the code dealing with reading
  the auth file was affected. The code calls sigprocmask() to block
  the signal (though it leaves some other calls unprotected) but the
  SIGCHLD was not included in the set.

- Added SIGCHLD to the set of signals that are blocked when reading
  the authorization file.

- As I was at it, I changed the path to the SecurityPolicy file. A
  few Linux ditributors ship the file in $LIBDIR/xserver, a few only
  in /etc/X11/xserver, most others in both places. It seems that
  those who ship in $LIBDIR/xserver do also in /etc/X11 but the op-
  posite is not true, so I switched to /etc/X11.

nx-X11-1.5.0-1

- Opened the 1.5.0 branch.

nx-X11-1.4.1-2

- Set parameter UseCygIPC on cygwin conf file in order to force the
  build of MIT-SHM estension.

- Removed some spurius object file.

nx-X11-1.4.1-1

- Opened the 1.4.1 branch.

nx-X11-1.4.0-8

- Changed DefaultFontPath and DefaultRGBDatabase in 
  NX-Cygwin.def.

nx-X11-1.4.0-7

- Imported dispatch in nxdarwin package, in order to let
  nxdarwin being able to detect new client connection.

- Changed the Xpm Imakefile to make also .a static library
  on Solaris. To link nxviewer and nxdestkop staticaly.

nx-X11-1.4.0-6

- XInput extension enabled on MacOSX.

- Added some missing backup files of the original XFree86
  package.

nx-X11-1.4.0-5

- Changed the mi Imakefile in order to let xfree86 servers use
  the normal mi extension initialization for the XInput exten-
  sion.

- XInput extension enabled on Solaris.

nx-X11-1.4.0-4

- Removed the RejectWellKnownSocket for the cygwin and
  MacOSX environments that doesn't use the Xtransport library.

nx-X11-1.4.0-3

- Changed the implementation of the reject method in the
  Xtransport library, now close any new incoming connection 
  immediately without reading or writing to it.

nx-X11-1.4.0-2

- Implemented a reject method in the Xtransport library,
  this function accept and close every connection attempt,
  on the specified listening socket.

- Added the new function RejectWellKnownSocket to the os
  connection code.
  This function use the new transport reject function on
  all listening socket.

nx-X11-1.4.0-1

- Opened the 1.4.0 branch.

- Removed forgotten nxagent-1.3.2-20 directory.

nx-X11-1.3.2-9

- Prevents NX Darwin server going through the reset. On Darwin
  we found that the it is not possible to get the correct key-
  board layout unless it is set on the local machine, before
  the NX session is started, by using xmodmap. As we set the
  keyboard locally, we must prevent the X server to reset, or
  we would loose any local configuration.

nx-X11-1.3.2-8

- Removed action associated to keysym XK_Terminate_Server. This
  could cause agent to be terminated when pressing shift + back-
  space if using the default US keyboard mapping.

- Disabled the remaining debug logs in lib/X11/PutImage.c

nx-X11-1.3.2-7

- Fixed the wrong programs/Xserver/Imakefile in 1.3.2-6 package.

nx-X11-1.3.2-6

- Changed the define from NX_CLEAN_IN_PLACE to NX_CLEAN_INPLACE.
  Definition of symbol is now placed in the Imakefile.

- The new _NXEnableCleanInplace Xlib variable does control which
  algorithm is used to clean the images. Setting NX_IMAGEINPLACE
  in the environment will activate the in-place cleanup.

- The default value of _NXEnableCleanInplace is -1. Leaving it to
  a value <= 0 disables use of CleanInplace.

nx-X11-1.3.2-5

- Patch in config/cf/sun.cf. Fix for libfontconfig compilation
  during gmake Everything on Solaris.

- Patch in lib/X11/Imakefile. Fix for nxcomp compilation during
  gmake World on Solaris.

nx-X11-1.3.2-4

- Image cleanup is now performed by using NXCleanInPlaceImage from
  nxcompext. This function saves a buffer copy by cleaning the
  padding bytes in the same buffer provided by the caller. Note that
  to prevent memory violations in the case the image was allocated
  in a static buffer, the function will temporarily redefine the
  SIGSEGV handler. The former handler is restored before returning
  to the caller. This can potentially affect some multithreaded
  clients. Is to be decided if the function is safe enough to be
  included in the production release.

nx-X11-1.3.2-3

- More debug logs in programs/Xserver/xkb/ddxLoad.c.

nx-X11-1.3.2-2

- Added NXmiwindow.o to NXAGENTOBJS in programs/Xserver/Imakefile.
  File was not linked into the resulting nxagent. This solves the
  problem of missing repaints in CDE and other Xt applications.

nx-X11-1.3.2-1

- Added some debug logs in programs/Xserver/xkb/ddxLoad.c. Function
  XkbDDXCompileKeymapByNames is called by OpenOffice to read the
  keyboard configuration whenever a drop-down menu is accessed. It
  seem to always fail with the following error:

  The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports:
  > Error:            Can't find file "unknown" for geometry include
  >                   Exiting
  >                   Abandoning geometry file "default"

- Opened the 1.3.2 development branch.

nx-X11-1.3.1-12

- Fixed a problem in xkb/ddxLoad.c on Solaris where Pclose was
  always returning an error code despite the fact that command
  was executed properly.

nx-X11-1.3.1-11

- Changed default GCC flags from '-O2 -fno-strength-reduce' to
  -O3. No platform where NX is targeted is currently using a
  GCC 2.x affected by the -fno-strength-reduce bug. Note also
  that nxcomp is already compiled with -O3 since 1.1.1, so it
  can be considered safe.

nx-X11-1.3.1-10

- Imported an updated fbcompose.c file from XFree86-4.3.99.902.
  This fixes "uninitialized value" problems reported by Valgrind.

- Fixed further buffer overflows by updating the following file
  with recent versions coming from the XFree86-4.3.99.902 tree.

  nx-X11/lib/font/fontfile/dirfile.c
  nx-X11/lib/font/fontfile/encparse.c
  nx-X11/lib/font/fontfile/fontfile.c

- Fixed a possible buffer overflow in lib/font/FreeType/fttools.c.
  Verified that the change is already in the XFree86 4.4.0 CVS.

nx-X11-1.3.1-9

- Fixed Xserver/Imakefile which was still referencing NXpixmap.o.

nx-X11-1.3.1-8

- Imported an updated fbgc.c from XFree86-4.3.99.902. This fixes
  some minor problems reported by Valgrind.

- A major problem was reported by Valgrind about reading after
  the block allocated in fbCreatePixmap from AllocatePixmap. The
  file pixmap.c has been modified so that 4 bytes are added to
  the pixmap buffer at any new allocation. This quick hack should
  solve the problem for both nxagent and the NXWin server. Further
  investigation is planned for the next release.

- Fixed Xtranssock.c to compile on Solaris where struct sigaction
  doesn't have the sa_restorer member.

nx-X11-1.3.1-5

- Renamed the NX-sun.def configuration file to NX-Sun.def.

- Renamed the non-standard NX_iPAQ_XServer and NX_Zaurus_XServer
  symbols to NXiPAQXServer and NXZaurusXServer.

- Added the missing sun.cf.XF86.original file in config/cf.

- Added the missing empty file host.def.XF86.original in the
  same directory.

- Added initialization of sa.sa_mask when setting sigaction()
  for SIGCHLD. The problem was reported by Valgrind running
  nxagent.

- Removed an unused block of code from WaitFor.c. The code had
  been commented out in previous versions.

- Removed the non-standard colon at the end of version in this
  CHANGELOG.

- Removed the spurious spaces in this CHANGELOG.

nx-X11-1.3.1-4

- Added a little workaround to the top Imakefile intended to
  hide the makedepend warnings about non portable whitespaces
  in sources.

nx-X11-1.3.1-3

- Fixed compilation problem with nxagent-1.3.1-13.

nx-X11-1.3.1-2

- Changes in NX-sun.def configuration file for Solaris to allow
  compilation of the XKB extension. 

nx-X11-1.3.1-1

- Opened the 1.3.1 development branch.

nx-X11-1.3.0-6

- Original output buffer size in stock XFree86 is 2048. We try
  to reduce context switches and help stream compression by
  increasing the maximum size of the buffer 8192. _NXFlushSize
  determines when the display buffer is actually flushed. It is
  set by default to 4096 but agents should set it to 0 if they
  want to disable early flush.

- Added the _NXLostSequenceFunction function pointer to let NX
  agents suppress the error message and modify the default Xlib
  behaviour when out-of-order sequence numbers are received.
