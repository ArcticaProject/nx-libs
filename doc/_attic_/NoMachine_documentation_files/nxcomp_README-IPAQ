1. Install a cross-compiler for ARM. You can find detailed
   informations at:

   http://www.ailis.de/~k/knowledge/crosscompiling/toolchain.php

   There are also binaries needed to install the cross-compiler.

2. Configure and compile libXcomp using:

   $ ./configure --with-ipaq
   $ make

   After compilation type:

   $ arm-linux-strip libXcomp.*

3. Remember that you also need nxproxy to actually run your NX X
   session.
