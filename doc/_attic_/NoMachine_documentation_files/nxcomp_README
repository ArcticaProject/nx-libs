Building
--------

1. To compile:

   > tar zxvf nxcomp-X.Y.Z-N.tar.gz
   > cd nxcomp
   > ./configure
   > make

   You'll have to run gmake under Solaris.

2. The 'make install' target is not currently supported
   in the Makefile, but it should be simple to fix.

You need at least nxproxy and nxagent packages to enjoy this code. Check the
NoMachine website at http://www.nomachine.com to get the latest release.
